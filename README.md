# Hey, I'm Jonathan — aka Trust-Worthy

## Gratitude

None of my accomplishments are mine alone. I’m deeply grateful to God and to the incredible people who’ve shaped my journey. If you’re reading this, take a moment to appreciate those who’ve helped you along yours.

**Interdisciplinary problem solver | Open Source Contributor | Security Researcher**

## What I Do

I explore and build at the intersection of open source software, cryptography, cybersecurity, anthropology, data science, criminology, and ethical AI. The most interesting problems rarely fit neatly into one box.

## Who I Work With

The best, brightest, and most passionate people I meet. Every great project is built by a great team.

## Why I Do It

Tackling difficult, undefined problems is how I serve others with creativity. It’s challenging, meaningful, and worth doing.

## Why You Should Care

The world needs more diverse, interdisciplinary teams. We’ve gotten too comfortable in our own corners of academia, business, and tech. True innovation happens when different skill sets, experiences, and perspectives collide.

## How You Can Help

1. Find a real-world problem that affects you **and** people different from you.
2. Gather a team of diverse, gifted individuals.
3. Start building—whether it’s a startup, a research project, or something entirely new.

## Where I’m Applying My Studies

Vulnerability research, secure software development, network security, and machine learning for criminology.

## Future Focus Areas

Post-quantum cryptography, human trafficking prevention, internet privacy, and Linux kernel development.

## Why Cybersecurity & Anthropology?

People often ask, *"Why both?"*

> Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The social sciences help contextualize cybersecurity, AI, and software within human culture and behavior. The more we understand people, the better we can build secure, ethical, and impactful technology.

## Outside of Tech

I love cinematography, filmmaking, and capturing artists in their flow state. Creativity, in any form, is a way to express our most authentic selves.

Let’s build something meaningful together.

If you'd like, I can also suggest a custom layout for your `README.md` to make it even more crisp (e.g., using collapsible sections or horizontal rules to structure it for readability). Want that too?
